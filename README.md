# TeamCommunication

This a program for LE2M ([https://github.com/dimdub34/le2m-v2.1](https://github.com/dimdub34/le2m-v2.1)).  

This part must be put in the directory le2m/parts. This way, LE2M will find
it and will be able to load it. 

Once loaded a new sub-menu in the menu Parts is added. This sub-menu manages the
part: configure, display parameters, start, display payoffs.  

Since this part is paired with the Dictator part it has also item that manages 
the group formation for the Dictator part (in order to avoid subjects in the 
Dictator to be paired with someone they were paired with in the TeamCommunication
part).
